## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

### **Answer:**

The most common sentiment observed in the sample was **negative**.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

### **Answer:**

I believe that if the input is properly formatted with clear, detailed instructions and monitored closely by a developer, the results can be reasonably reliable. In my case, after many iterations of prompt refinement, the output became more consistent. However, the inherent risk of model hallucinations remains: the model may occasionally produce extra or inaccurate labels that don’t correspond to the actual sentiment of the review. It’s also important to remember that sentiment labeling is quite subjective, and even two people might interpret the same review differently - so it’s not surprising that an LLM can sometimes return inconsistent results on the same input.
So while the system works pretty well with clear prompts and under control, there’s still a need to keep an eye on it and double-check the results to avoid mistakes and make sure it really reflects what users are saying.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

### **Answer:**

Most of the reviews were negative, which shows there’s definitely room for improvement. A lot of people complained about the taste - especially saying it tastes like plastic or that it used to be better before the formula changed.

So I’d suggest the company focus on fixing the flavor and maybe go back to the original formula or packaging people liked more. They shouldn’t just stick to what they’re doing now — there’s clearly an opportunity to make it better and win back customers.
